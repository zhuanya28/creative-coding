    <p class="description">For this recitation, we were asked to create a particle pattern that would resemble something
      that we can see in
      the
      real world. We ere required to utilize a self-contained Class that would have different properties and multiple
      methods.
      Also, we were asked to deploy dynamic arrays.

      So, I have created these bubbles that move depending on the Mouse position (and + they have their own speed as a
      default. They also slowly disappear and randomly appear on the screen, renewing themselves. Moreover, you can
      hover
      and
      pop them üôÇ

      I really liked this shading component and thinking of deploying it in my project a! As well as some kind of
      bubbles
      like
      that.

      What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a Class and an Instance of the Class?
      OOP is a way of programming that revolves around reusability of the methods and data.

      Class is a data structure that contains properties and methods that could be manipulated hence reused.

      Instance of the class is the object that you can create an ‚Äúobject‚Äù that would have the properties and the methods
      of
      the class.

      Discuss the effectiveness of OOP. When is OOP useful? In what way can it be utilized?
      It is very useful when you want to create the same types of objects that have the same properties and methods,
      meaning
      that they have the same patterns of behavior but behave differently. With the use of loops and dynamic arrays you
      can
      create highly responsive and interesting visuals and interactive experiences that would have been very slow and
      hurtful
      otherwise.

      Describe the objects you have created. What properties and methods were implemented? What kind of behaviors did
      you
      create by manipulating them?
      I have created a Class Particle that has position, color, opacity as well as the speed in both directions and
      size.

      The methods include the independent movement (move()), movement determined by mouse position (moveFrom()),
      color/opacity
      (changeColors()), popping hovered that return ‚Äúpop‚Äù if the bubble of hovered on (popIfHovered()), as well as
      display().

      Please share it if there is any challenging and confusing aspect(s) in the OOP concepts and techniques?
      I got pretty familiar with all the features at this point (I think), so I don‚Äôt have anything about this data
      structure
      that confuses me.
